# 🧠 ML-Game (Graduation Project)

A Unity-based game project where enemy agents are trained using machine learning to locate randomly spawned treasure chests. The player tries to stop them using bombs before they reach the treasure chest.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- Unity (2D)
- C#
- ML-Agents Toolkit
- Python (for training)
- Visual Studio
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🚀 Features

- [x] ML-trained agents with decision-making brains  
- [x] Randomized treasure and enemy spawn positions  
- [x] Bomb mechanic to eliminate enemies  
- [x] Game over / win conditions  
- [x] (Bonus) A slowing mechanic that *almost* worked 😄

## 🧠 ML Agent Training

Agents were trained using Unity ML-Agents Toolkit with reward signals based on distance to target and success in locating treasure. The trained brain was then exported and assigned to enemy prefabs in the Unity scene.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Download and extract the release build  
2. Launch the `.exe` file  
3. Enemies will start searching for the treasure automatically  
4. Use **left click** and drag bombs.
5. Try to destroy the agents before they reach the treasure.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Built and trained reinforcement learning agents in a Unity environment  
- Implemented dynamic enemy behavior without hard-coded paths  
- Balanced game logic with AI performance  
- Gained hands-on experience with ML pipelines inside game engines
